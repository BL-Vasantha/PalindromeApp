# PalindromeCheckerAppManagementSystem


## 📌 Objective
The objective of the **PalindromeChecker App** is to design and implement a
**console-based Java application** that validates whether a given string is a
palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening **core programming
fundamentals** and **data structure concepts**.

## 🚀 Use Case 2 (UC2): Print a Hardcoded Palindrome Result

### 🎯 Goal
Display whether a hardcoded string is a palindrome.

### 👤 Actor
User

---

### 🔄 Flow
1. Program starts.
2. A hardcoded string is initialized.
3. The string is checked for palindrome logic.
4. The result is printed on the console.
5. Program exits.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used in UC2

- **Class**  
  In Java, every program must be written inside a class.  
  The class acts as a container for program logic.

- **Main Method**  
  Entry point of the Java application with the signature:  
  `public static void main(String[] args)`

- **Static Keyword**  
  Allows the JVM to invoke the `main()` method without creating
  an object of the class.

- **String**  
  A built-in Java class used to store and manipulate textual data.
  Here, it stores the word to be checked for a palindrome.

- **String Literal**  
  Text enclosed within double quotes (e.g., `"madam"`),
  stored in the String Constant Pool.

- **Loop (for loop)**  
  Iterates only till half of the string length to compare characters
  from both ends.

- **Conditional Statement (if-else)**  
  Used to verify whether the string satisfies the palindrome condition.

- **Console Output**  
  `System.out.println()` is used to display the input and result.
